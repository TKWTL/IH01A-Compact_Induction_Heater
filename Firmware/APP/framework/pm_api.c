/* Application layer of the power framework: owns the controller instance, the
 * block mask and the wake bookkeeping.  thread_pm (APP/app_tasks.c) calls
 * pm_api_poll() every 50 ms; thread_ui reads pm_api_ui_should_block() and
 * forwards key activity through pm_api_refresh_idle().
 *
 * Ported from the two reference projects, keeping the Pocket_PowerBank fixes:
 *  - pm_api_force_sleep() drops any pending refresh request before latching
 *    the forced expiry, otherwise an already-queued key/plug event would pull
 *    the state machine straight back to RUN;
 *  - the "No Auto Sleep" timeout uses pm_sleep_timer_disable() (countdown
 *    stopped) instead of the old magic maximum timeout value.
 *
 * The force latch persists throughout UI_OFF, including while automatic
 * sleep is blocked by a frozen timer (e.g. heater active). Ordinary activity
 * never cancels an explicit manual sleep; a debounced physical key explicitly
 * requests wake. The latch clears only on UI_OFF -> RUN. */
